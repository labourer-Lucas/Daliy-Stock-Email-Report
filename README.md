- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates metrics such as earnings rate, target earnings rate, and earnings coefficient rank, with self-designed algorithm.
- **Scheduling**: Automates email sending at three specific times throughout the day.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

Install the dependencies via conda:

```bash
PS ...\Daliy-Stock-Email-with-quant> conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Setup

1. **Email Configuration**: Add a `config.json` file under the `config/` directory with the following structure:

   ```json
   {
     "sender_email": "your_email@gmail.com",
     "sender_password": "your_password",
     "smtp_server": "smtp.gmail.com",
     "smtp_port": 587,
     "receiver_email": "receiver_email@gmail.com",
     "holding_path": "config/Holdings.xlsx",
     "watching_path": "config/Watching_list.xlsx"
   }
   ```

2. **Adapt Holdings and Watchlist Excel Files**: Ensure your holdings and watchlist are saved in separate Excel files with the required columns:

   - Holdings file should contain columns: `Ticker`, `AveragePrice`, `Shares`
   - Watchlist file should contain column: `Ticker`

## Quick Start

Start by running  `dailyReport.py`

```bash
...\Daliy-Stock-Email-with-quant> python src/dailyReport.py
```

## Earning Coefficient

$$
EarningCoefficient=ln(e\times \frac{Target\ High\ Price}{Current\ Price})\times ln(e\times \frac{Target\ Low\ Price}{Current\ Price})
$$
